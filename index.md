# Heartbeat Chimes

Gentle percussion music composed by the human heartbeat. Unwind, relax, and get back in touch with the natural rhythm of your body while listening to the soothing sound of heartbeat-driven chimes.


## Heartbeats and Music

The heartbeat is one of the most familiar, instantly recognizable and calming rhythms; listening to a heartbeat has been shown to relieve anxiety, lower blood pressure and increase empathy. Heartbeat Chimes play in time with each single heartbeat, creating ever-varying melodies that reflect the constant changes in heart rate. 

This unique combination of a natural heart rhythm and gentle percussion instruments creates a mesmerizing, deeply soothing aural experience that will help you re-center and de-stress, whatever your day throws at you.

## Technology

Heartbeat Chimes work with RR intervals from a standard heart rate monitor, of the type used for training - either live, for a mesmerising biofeedback experience, or from saved data. Send us your heartbeat data today for a personalised melody!

* Re-grounding, fighting anxiety, increasing awareness
* Helping you focus while fending off stress
* As a background for yoga, meditation session

Heartbeat music can also add an intimate, personal dimension to interactive installations and artistic projects
